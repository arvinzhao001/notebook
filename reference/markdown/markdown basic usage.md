# Italics and Bold
You can use _both italics and bold_ in the same line. You can also span them **across multiple words**. and making the words **_This is unbelievable_** both bold and italic is also easy.

# Headers
To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.
## Header two
### Header three
#### Header four
##### Header five
###### Header six

# Links
## Inline Link
To create a inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, [**Search for it.**](www.google.com)

## Reference Link
An advantage of the reference link style is that multiple links to the same place only need to be updated once.

Do you want to [a fun place][a fun place]

Yes, I want to [the fun place][a fun place]

[a fun place]:www.google.com
# Images
Images also have two styles, just like links, The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).

# Blockquotes
If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source. For example:
>1.Where there is a will, there is a way.

>1.You cannot eat your cake and have it too.
>
>2.When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

# Lists
There are two types of lists: unordered and ordered
## Unordered List
To created an unordered list, you can preface each item in the list with an asterisk(*). A grocery list:
* Milk
* Eggs
* Butter
## Ordered List 
An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks:
1. Milk
2. Eggs
3. Butter
## Nested List
You might find the need to make a list with more depth. All you have to do is to remember to indent each asterisk one space more than the preceding item.
* Meet
  * Pork 
  * Beef
* Vegetable
  * Tomato
  * Potato
